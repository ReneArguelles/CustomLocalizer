The CSV file to use for localizing strings needs to be formatted in the following way:

- the first row needs to have the language codes, ie: en,fr,es,nl
- the other rows need to be the sentences for each language, ie: Monday,Lundi,Lunes,Maandag

If the CSV is for updating UI elements, please check the checkbox below. This will prevent the app from updating the Localizable.strings files and go directly to the other .strings files.
